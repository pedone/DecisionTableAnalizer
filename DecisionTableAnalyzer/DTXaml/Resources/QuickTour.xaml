    <sys:String x:Key="QuickTourHeader">Welcome to DTA - Decision Table Analyzer</sys:String>

    <sys:String x:Key="QuickTourText">
        In order to give you a quick orientation to the program we put some information here showing you the fastest way to your decision table. 
        The view you are seeing right now is the "start view". This is the place you start on DTA startup. But as many things more this behavior can be changed.
        Click on "New Project" on the left hand side. Now enter a name, describing the project and a description. Submit your data by pressing "Ok".  
        If you are wondering why a blank, blue area shows up - there is a reason. DTA does not know by default what you want to do after loading/creating a project. But you can change this yourself by changing the value of the dropdown box on the start view to a value different than "No View".
        Now open the Requirements Manager by selecting the appropriate insert from the "View" menu. Now define your functional and non-functional requirements. Open the decision table manager by selecting it in the "view" menu. You can create from one up to many decision tables with different conditions and actions.
        These must be defined in the decision table details view. You can access it by clicking on the lower middle icon.
        Specify the conditions and actions in the common way and return to the decision table manager view. 
        Now that you have supplied DTA with all required data you can finally generate the decision table.
        Specify the rules you need or simply generate them. These and other handy functions are provided by the lower buttons.
        Now that you have completed this tour you are ready to launch!
